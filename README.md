This is a companion software to the manuscript

[M. Caliari and F. Cassini. Matrix- and tensor-oriented numerical schemes for
the evolutionary space-fractional complex Ginzburg--Landau equation,
2025](https://doi.org/TODO)

In particular, it contains all the functions and the scripts needed to 
reproduce the MATLAB numerical experiments of the manucript.

Notice that, to make the code fully working in GNU Octave, you need to modify
the files
 ```tucker3d.m``` and  ```ttucker3d```.
 In particular, you need to uncomment line 9 and comment line 11.
